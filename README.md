# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains various C++ programs that demonstrate data structures and algorithms, implemented for learning and practice purposes.

## Contents
The repository currently includes:
- Queue implementation using arrays.
- Singly linked list implementation with various insertion and deletion operations.


## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
3. Compile the C++ files using any C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Future Scope
More programs and algorithms will be added over time to expand the collection, including:
- Stacks
